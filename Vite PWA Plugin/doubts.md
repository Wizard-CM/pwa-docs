**In local development || build server , No matter what you strategies you apply ,In offline mode after multiple refreshes , your PWA will crash.**

# Doubt 1
In offline mode && In local (development || build) server && while using vite react application , 
Your application might crash after multiple refreshes, due to combination of multiple reasons and some of them could be ? 

* Service Worker Caching:
- The service worker caches the about page initially, so it works offline.
- After multiple refreshes, critical assets (like workbox-* or index.html) might not be cached or available offline.

* Offline and Routing Issues:
- In local setups, requests to routes (e.g., /about) expect index.html for SPAs, but the local server might not serve it properly.
- Missing or failed routing leads to a crash when assets aren't found.

* Cache Invalidation:
- Cached assets might expire or become inconsistent if the service worker mishandles updates or reaches storage limits.


* Difference in Local vs. Deployed:
- Local servers don't fully replicate production server behaviors, like handling route fallbacks properly.
- Deployed apps have better routing, caching, and static file serving, preventing these crashes.

**Therefore , there isn't a very specific reason to this behaviour.**
